# An advanced problem in Computer Science
Hi, welcome.

**I'm Dung Manh Nguyen**, a 3rd year Computer Science (CS) student in University of Technology and Engineering - Vietnam National University (VNU).

Computer Science is a quite different from other discipline in that it is quite extensive and problem oriented. Nowadays, Computer Science evolves with technology. The CS are changing the world daily with their applications. You might hear about some latest techonology in CS such as: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Block-chain, Internet of things, etc.

However, the Computer Science of today is not the same as the one that was studied in the 1950’s because in the 1950’s operating system and the internet were not born yet. In this repository, I will go deeper inside Object detection in Deep learning, one of many fields that (at the moments) are affecting the world silently. 

Enjoy!
